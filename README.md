# lendsqr-fe-test
This project is an assessment test given by Lendsqr for a frontend engineer position.

# Things to note
* There is a 2 second delay timer on the login page to simulate sending a request.

* The filter component is only available on the icon beside the organisation tab in the table.

* On the username tab in the userlist table, usernames are clickable and would route to the user detail page. Same route is on the "view details" popup options.

* On the user list table, the status tab list is hardcoded since API does not return status property.

* Both the dashboard and user menu on the sidebar/mobile menu routes to the same page.

* The remaining of the sidebar/mobile links would lead to an unhandled application error (404) since no routes are defined for them.
